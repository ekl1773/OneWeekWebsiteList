OneWeekWebsiteList
==================

A malleable stratagem for the creation of my personal webpage, including associated research and personal development.

The document "OneWeekWebsiteList" over in the gh-pages branch is my alternative to constantly updating a blog post and copying the same text back and forth repeatedly. I work with OmmWriter on my laptop and drafted my initial list there. 

Hopefully following through on this will net me a shiny personal website I feel proud of and can use for self-promotion. Please check out blogposts on the subject at <a href="http://renascencegirl.blogspot.com">renascencegirl</a> (for now).
