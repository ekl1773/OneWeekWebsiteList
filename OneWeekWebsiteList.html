<li><a href="http://renascencegirl.blogspot.com/2013/02/gitifying-oneweekwebsitelist.html">Gitifying the OneWeekWebsiteList</a>-<del>Regarding what a pain in the butt this silly todo list system was.</del></li>
<li><a href="">OOW Tidying up</a>-<del>Draft <pre><code><li></code></pre> posts; tidy up this <pre><code><ul></code></pre>. Code, pre, object elements?</del></li>
<li>[private] Draft a list of places doing work like what I want to be doing</li>
		<ul>
		<li>[private] Reasons I want to work @ ___</li>
		<li>Write post based on generalities of the ideal place I'd like to work: see flower exercise. [post on moonshot/motivation/challenge to follow- moonshots as reinventing the wheel]</li>
		</ul>
<li>Update and redesign resume as trial run on box-model/html layout</li>
<li>Process: taken from UX class, Moxie Girls rollout schedule, other sources? motto for now: good enough. For later: nigh unto perfection.</li>
<li>Sketch out basic layout, general components, structure, categories (use a "hosted on" link at the bottom to rec ppl)</li>
<li>Mockup version in Balsamic and Justinmind</li>
<li>Figure out more about Git tracking, determine what to put on Github, or not, whether it works for WP installs? or is that just dumb? And also: proper syntax for commit msgs?</li>
<li>Box model-ify with divs</li>
<li>Style sheet-ify</li>
<li>Figure out db mysql php and mostly how it relates to CMS usage</li>
<li>Install WP (for starters) in a sub directory, under the splash page (totally silly?)</li>
		<ul>
		<li>How to install multiple CMSs in subdirectories- at all reasonable? trying a different CMS for different purposes? one for blog, one for portfolio...</li>
		<li>Explain why CMS instead of LR gallery. Or could a LR gallery work (read tutorials for LR publish and Web)? How much content do I want to have up? what are the functionalities I need? How do the different options meet those needs? Content management- how to upload/update whenever edits are made in LR? FTP to site? published collections? downloading comments to LR- social photo sharing v. gallery - comments on blog, not photos? when to use tags/categories in WP?</li>
		<li>Review WP, Drupal, Joomla...compare and contrast etc, which is useful for what?</li>
		</ul>
<li>Add blog to site</li>
		<ul>
		<li>Add share buttons for individ posts, somehow</li>
		</ul>
<li>[+ some lessons I've learned about learning: pacing, knowledge relevant to current task, goal-setting, procrastination by 'learning', total avoidance of actual progress by learning, application of new knowledge rather than 'degree touting']</li>
<li>Add other types of things to professional portfolio, tweaks for Nick, page for Lisa, etc</li>
<li>Contract draft for any hypothetical freelance needs- contract killer, Moxie Girls...</li>
</ul>
