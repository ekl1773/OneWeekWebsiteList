<h5>.To.Do.</h5>
<ul>
<li>Post about what a pain in the butt this silly todo list system was.</li>
<li>Draft some line item posts to store links and notes in until I get to that item; tidy up this unordered list a bit. And figure out why code/pre tags aren't working.</li>
	<li>Make a list of places doing work like what I want to be doing</li>
		<ul>
		<li>[private] Reasons I want to work @ ___</li>
		<li>Write post based on generalities of the ideal place I'd like to work: see flower exercise</li>
		</ul>
<li>Update and redesign resume as trial run on box-model/html layout</li>
<li>Process: taken from UX class, Moxie Girls rollout schedule, other sources?</li>
<li>Sketch out basic layout, general components, structure, categories (use a "hosted on" link at the bottom to rec ppl)</li>
<li>Mockup version in Balsamic and Justinmind</li>
<li>Figure out more about Git tracking, determine what to put on Github, or not, whether it works for WP installs? or is that just dumb? And also: proper syntax for commit msgs?</li>
<li>Box model-ify with divs</li>
<li>Style sheet-ify</li>
<li>Figure out db mysql php and mostly how it relates to CMS usage</li>
<li>Install WP (for starters) in a sub directory, under the splash page (totally silly?)</li>
		<ul>
		<li>How to install multiple CMSs in subdirectories- at all reasonable? trying a different cms for different purposes? one for blog, one for portfolio...</li>
		<li>Explain why CMS instead of LR gallery. Or could a LR gallery work (read tutorials for LR publish and Web)? How much content do I want to have up? what are the functionalities I need? How do the different options meet those needs? Content management- how to upload/update whenever edits are made in LR? FTP to site? published collections? downloading comments to LR- social photo sharing v. gallery - comments on blog, not photos? when to use tags/categories in WP?</li>
		<li>Review WP, Drupal, Joomla...compare and contrast etc, which is useful for what?</li>
		</ul>
<li>Add blog to site</li>
		<ul>
		<li>Add share buttons for individ posts, somehow</li>
		</ul>
<li>Add other types of things to professional portfolio, tweaks for Nick, page for Lisa, etc</li>
<li>Contract draft for any hypothetical freelance needs- contract killer, Moxie Girls...</li>
</ul>
